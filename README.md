# About

The EICN bought a Picoscope 4262 2-channel oscilloscope with arbitrary waveform generation built-in. I want to be able to stream data from it and analyze it in real time.

## Requisite installation

1. Install the Picoscope SDK <https://www.picotech.com/downloads/_lightbox/pico-software-development-kit-64bit>
2. Copy the picosdk-python-wrappers repository from github
3. Activate a python virtual environment, navigate to the copied repo, and run `pip install .`
